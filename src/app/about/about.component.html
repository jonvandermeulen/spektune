                <p dir="auto">An application for translating data into MIDI files (and ultimately, into music). The
                    concept was inspired
                    by and developed in collaboration with Ryan Vandermeulen, Satellite Oceanographer at NASA Goddard's
                    Ocean Ecology
                    Laboratory.</p>
                <p dir="auto">Simply paste a list of numbers into the system, and listen to the results. Change the key, 
                    the scales, the timing, the instruments... See where it takes you! Spektune Composer has a built-in
                    player based on <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">ToneJS</a> and Benjamin Gleitzman's 
                    <a href="https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts">pre-rendered soudnfonts</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>For best results</strong>, use Spektune to generate a MIDI file and import it into any 
                    Digial Audio Workstation. There are some <a href="https://musicproductionnerds.com/free-digital-audio-workstations">
                        really great free options</a> available. All of our sample songs were produced in GarageBand.</p>
                
                <h2>How it started</h2>
                <p>Our original plan was to turn reflectance data gathered by NASA satellites into music, in order to
                    highlight the natural harmonies of blue/green/red light being reflected (or absorbed) by our ocean
                    the microscopic life in it.</p>
                <p>Initial attempts proved interesting, but suffered from poor-quality instruments and limited expression options.</p>
                
                <h2>How it's going</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.spektune.com/composer">Spektune Composer</a> was developed to help us experiment 
                and blend musical theory with raw numbers - in a way that turns objective science into subjective beauty.</p>
                <p>Anyone can use this tool. We would love to hear what you come up with! Share it with us @Spektune on <a href="https://twitter.com/Spektune">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spektune">Instagram</a>.</p>


                <h2 dir="auto">How it works</h2>
                <p dir="auto">Generate a MIDI track by supplying data and selecting configuration options for the
                    musical
                    interpreter.</p>
                <p>Select a key/scale that you want the data to conform to, along with an octave range.
                    Provide a list of line-break-delimited numbers. Spektune will normalize the data and map each
                    data point to a note on the selected key/scale/octaves. Options can be specified to govern
                    the performance of the data. For instance, tie repeated notes together to form one longer note.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Once the data is processed by this tool</strong>, you can import the resulting MIDI file into 
                    any Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software, where you can further develop the song.</p>

                <h3 dir="auto">How to Use Spektune Composer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter a name for your composition</li>
                    <li>Select a <strong>Key Note and Scale</strong>. This determines which notes should be mapped to
                        the
                        data. This value can be overridden in individual tracks.</li>
                    <li>Add a track</li>
                    <li>Paste your data into the form. Data should be a line-break-delimited set of numeric values.
                        (Support for things like CSV files coming soon), and configure options:
                        <ul>

                                mallet instruments like Xylophone. May cause a bit of cacaphony when used with Piano or

                                Allows you to shift the timing of tracks so that they don't all strike notes at

                <!-- <p dir="auto"><strong>Modulation</strong>: Supply additional data and/or create rules to govern 
                                    adjustments to the track. Examples:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Modwheel</b>: The Modulation Wheel controls low-frequency oscillator (LFO) of 0-100 Hz that governs (depending 
                                        on the instrument) oscillations of pitch, volume, or other filters. Low values can sound like vibrato, high values 
                                        can sound like a science fiction.</li>
                                    <li><b>Aftertouch</b>: Aftertouch is how "hard" a key is being pressed while the note is playing. 
                                        How this will sound depends on the settings in the instrument you are playing. 
                                        This is particularly fun with synth sounds.</li>
                                    <li><b>Portamento</b>: Turn on/off "Portamento" (causing notes to "slide" into each other, instead
                                        of playing distinct pitches)</li>
                                    <li><b>Velocity</b>: Controls how hard a note is struck initially. This can often change the timbre of the note
                                        (think of how a different piano sounds when you hit a key soft or hard).</li>

                <p><b style="font-size: 22px">Ryan Vandermeulen</b> is a Satellite Oceanographer at NASA Goddard's Ocean
                    Ecology
                    Laboratory.</p>

                <p>"The ocean is blue... sort of," Ryan explains, "but the color palette of the ocean is much more than
                    just blue."
                    NASA satellites measure light reflected from the ocean's surface, using instruments that detect
                    specific wavelengths
                    of light - like red, green, and blue (albeit in a much more complicated science-y way). The
                    intensity of these colors,
                    and their relative values to each other tell us about the balance of microscopic life in the ocean -
                    phytoplankton that
                    are responsible for generating much of the oxygen that we breathe.</p>

                <p>The data can look chaotic.</p>

                <p>"Nothing is linear in nature, and nothing is predictable beyond first order tendencies. But within
                    the chaos is an
                    overtly sophisticated order that we owe our lives to."</p>

                <p>Ryan created a prototype song developed from a transect (sequential data that represents a
                    line drawn across the map, as it were) of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

                <p>He worked with his brother, Jon, to turn the data into music. <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiQ4sQyYyrc" target="_blank">See the results here</a>.</p>

                <p>"These melodies are simply a manifestation of natural patterns created by microscopic life in the
                    ocean."</p>

                <p>Ryan lives near Washington, D.C.. When he is not doing
                    science in the lab, he is doing science in the kitchen and makes keen observations of the natural
                    world
                    with his young daughter.</p>

                <p><b style="font-size: 22px">Jon Vandermeulen</b> is a veteran software engineer, with over 25 years
                    experience developing web applications. </p>

                <p>"When Ryan emailed me his idea and a (really, quite terrible) audio rendering, I told him that I was
                    going to help him
                    and he didn't have a choice about that," says Jon.</p>

                <p>"Our first attempt used a browser-based audio engine called <a
                        href="https://tonejs.github.io/">ToneJS</a> - which is awesome for what it is
                    (a simple-ish way to play instruments in a web browser), but not awesome for what it isn't (a
                    studio-quality
                    Digital Audio Workstation)."</p>

                <p>Over the course of 18 months, the project evolved into a system for generating note data that could
                    be <i>imported into</i>
                    any DAW via Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files.</p>

                <p>"Music has always been a part of our lives," Jon says. "Ryan and I both spent some time nursing
                    delusions of Rock-Stardom,
                    but we never seriously collaborated on anything."</p>

                <p>Jon lives in Houston, TX. When he is not engineering software, he is being raised by his wife and
                    three teen children.</p>
