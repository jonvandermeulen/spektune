# Spektune
An application for translating data into MIDI files (and ultimately, into music). The concept was inspired by and developed in collaboration with Ryan Vandermeulen, Satellite Oceanographer at NASA Goddardâ€™s Ocean Ecology Laboratory.

Prototype songs were built from spectrographic data obtained from NASA Earth-observation satellites. A mathematical translation of the spectral variation in the Blue, Green, and Red reflectance is normalized across a set of octaves and musical scale.

We developed a tool to create note data and MIDI files from a column of numbers (normalized or not). Resulting files can be imported into any DAW worth it's salt. In our case, Garage Band (because, at $free it's a bargain at twice the price)

## How it works

User gerenates a MIDI "track" by supplying data and selecting configuration options for the musical interpreter.

[See the About page for more info](http://localhost:4200/about).

## Development

This is an Angular 13 app using Bootstrap 5. You know what to do.

There is a Dockerfile in here that _does not work_. If you care enough about that, please fix it for me, thx.
